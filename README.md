| Being a developer is a great thing for creating your own game.<br>But a good game needs some good assets. In order to create 2D games, you will have <br>to search for tiles, tilesets, sprites, and sprite sheets.<br>Fortunately, some talented artists are willing to share their works on platforms like: <br>itch.io<br>In any case, try to respect other people’s work. |
