| Being a developer is a great thing for creating your own game.<br>But a good game needs some good assets. In order to create 2D games, you will have <br>to search for tiles, tilesets, sprites, and sprite sheets.<br>Fortunately, some talented artists are willing to share their works on platforms like: <br>[itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-sprites)<br>In any case, try to respect other people’s work. |

| It’s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project! |
| **so long** will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,<br>event handling, colors, textures, and so forth. |
| You are going to use the school graphical library: **the MiniLibX!**<br>This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. |
| The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level<br>up in **C** programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth. |
